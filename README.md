Bias Checker
==============
This is a flask web app which contains a bias checker. It can 
check your if your writing is bias or not, and score it relatively
from `0% to 100%`.
----------------------
To run/deploy the web app:

- `git clone https://github.com/rohan23rao/Bias-Checker`

Then, make sure `python 3.9` is installed, and create a venv
from the requirements.txt file:
- `python -m venv venv`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now, you can run the web application by running the file `flaskblog.py`,
and you should have a webpage up and running!****
